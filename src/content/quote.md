Quotes come in three main flavours:

1. **Pull quotes** _pull_ a passage of text out of the main text column and give it a distinct look; often to add visual interest or to make an important point visible at a glance.
2. **Block quotes** are quotations from an outside source. They are usually included within the text column, but in their own 'block', often with distinct style, to differentiate them from regular text. As these are quotations from an outside source, they will often include a citation.
3. **Inline quotes** are set within normal paragraph text; with only punctuation marks used to differentiate them from regular text.

## Usage guidelines

- Including pull quotes on smaller devices can be difficult as everything has to fit within a narrow single column.
- Limit the number of pull quotes you use, so that they do not lose their impact.
- Use the right type of quote for the job: not every external quotation needs to be placed in a block quote; consider positioning shorter quotes inline.
