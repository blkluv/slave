**Started in early 2019, _The Component Gallery_ is the product of an ongoing survey into the components that make up design systems**. It exists primarily as a collection of component examples grouped by type of component. I created this website to help with some of the problems that I experience every day as a front-end developer:

1. There are huge number of interface problems that have **already been solved**: there’s no need to reinvent the wheel every time you start a new project. Grouping examples by type of component makes it simple to find all the relevant examples for a specific interface problem.
2. **Naming things is hard**: If you don’t know what to call a thing, looking at what other people are calling similar things is a great place to start.

**Caveat:** Don’t just assume because an opinion is popular, it’s correct. Be wary of [information cascades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_cascade) and, if you can, always base your decisions on **research**. [***Definitely*** don’t just copy what everyone else is doing](https://noti.st/stephenhay/nLABeP/i-don-t-care-what-airbnb-is-doing-and-neither-should-you). There’s a tonne of research out there already—look for design systems that give reasoning for decisions based on real research.

## FAQs

### What is a component?

A component is a single, _reusable_ chunk of a user interface. It can contain other components (e.g. a form can contain many inputs).

### Are Web Components components?

[Web Components](https://www.webcomponents.org/introduction) are a collection of browser features and JavaScript APIs that allow developers to define custom elements by _extending_ native HTML elements.

### What about React components?

Yup

<!-- **Short answer:** Yes -->

<!-- **Longer answer**React is a great way to start thinking of user interfaces in a component-based way. While you _could_ put your whole interface in one single react component, you'll quickly see the benefit of splitting recurring patterns into separate component files, each with their own props, state, and methods. -->

### What’s the difference between a Design System and a Component Library?

A successful design system is more then just a component library, although it’s often a core piece. The extras include guidance on exactly how and when to use each component as well as more general rules around colour palettes, tooling and language usage.

### Are components just for websites?

**Absolutely not.** Component-based User-Interface design was around way before websites existed; the examples on this website are collected from websites because this is a _website_ created by a _web developer_. However, with the power of technologies such as [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) and [Electron](https://electronjs.org/), components can be cross-platform with exactly the same code being used on a website, a mobile app or a desktop app.
