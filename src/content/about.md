**_The Component Gallery_ is a collection of interface components from real-world design systems**. It's designed to help with some of the problems that I experience every day as a front-end developer:

1. There are some interface problems that have **already been solved**: there’s no need to reinvent the wheel every time you start a new project. Grouping examples by type of component makes it simple to find all the relevant examples for a specific interface problem.
2. **Naming things is hard**: If you don’t know what to call a thing, looking at what other people are calling similar things is a great place to start.

**Caveat:** Don’t just assume because an opinion is popular, it’s correct. Be wary of [information cascades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_cascade) and, if you can, always base your decisions on **research**. [**_Definitely_** don’t just copy what everyone else is doing](https://noti.st/stephenhay/nLABeP/i-don-t-care-what-airbnb-is-doing-and-neither-should-you). There’s a tonne of research out there already—look for design systems that give reasoning for decisions based on real research.

## FAQs

### Why components?

> “Components is a damn fine way to build a website”

> – <cite>Chris Coyier</cite>

Designing interfaces around components, specifically components from a design system, has a number of benefits:

1. **Consistency**: Using a design system can help maintain a consistent "look and feel" across multiple interfaces.
2. **Reusability**: Instead of building something from scratch, reusing something that's already been tried, tested, and proven to work can speed up development.
3. **A common language**: Design systems can help all teams involved in a project communicate effectively, using a shared set of names for things that everyone understands.

This website focuses on components over the other aspects of a design system because they're the most visible, tangible elements.

### What is a component?

A component is a single, reusable chunk of a user interface.

### Can a component contain other components?

Yes, a component can contain other components, in fact this nesting of components to build interfaces is fundamental to methodologies such as [Atomic Design](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/).

### Are Web Components components?

[Web Components](https://www.webcomponents.org/introduction) are a collection of browser features and JavaScript APIs that allow developers to define custom elements by extending native HTML elements. Web Components aren't just another framework, they're a standardised way to build components that work across browsers and devices, without the need to load hundreds of kilobytes of JavaScript.

### What about React/Vue/[JavaScript library of the week] components?

Yup.

### What’s the difference between a Design System and a Component Library?

A successful design system is way more than a website showing a few components, even if components often play an important part. A good design system is a constantly evolving set of shared practices, covering a wide range of topics including: colour palettes, typography, processes, accessibility, tooling and 'tone of voice'. Design systems also require a human element: without people using and contributing to the system, it will fail. The components themselves should be supported by guidance on exactly _how_, _when_, and when _not_ to use a component.

### Are components just for websites?

Absolutely not: component-based User-Interface design was around way before websites existed; the examples on this website are collected from the web because it's the easiest place to find public design systems. However, with the power of technologies such as [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) and [Electron](https://electronjs.org/), components can be cross-platform with exactly the same code being used on a website, a mobile app or a desktop app.

### How do I go about making a design system?
