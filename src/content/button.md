## Description

It's important to make a differentiation here: when people talk about buttons in regards to the web, they're usually talking about one of two things:

1. A `<button>` element which, depending on its type attribute, will initiate some kind of action; usually submitting a form or triggering some javascript.
2. Any other interactive html element that looks like a button, but isn’t a `<button>`.

## Usage guidelines

- If you can, make buttons look like buttons and links look like links[^1]. Users expect certain behaviours from links (e.g. middle click to open in new tab) and others from a button (e.g. 'click' with the space key); if those expectations are not met, users may get confused or frustrated.
