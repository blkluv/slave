A button group is a wrapper for related buttons; useful if you want to display multiple actions together.

## Usage guidelines

- Add the correct **role** attribute to the button group: e.g. `role="group"` or `role="toolbar"`, to communicate that the buttons are grouped to users of assistive technologies.
- Be **consistent** with the order of buttons between button groups. One possible rule is to keep primary actions (e.g. submitting a form) on the right and secondary actions (e.g. cancel, go back) on the left.
